# Label Generator

A full-stack label management system for creating storage bin labels with photos, manufacturer information, part numbers, and stock quantities. The backend offers a REST API with PDF exports while the React frontend lets you manage templates, labels, and build print queues.

## Architecture

- **Backend** – Flask API with SQLite persistence, PDF rendering via ReportLab, and image fetching through Requests.
- **Frontend** – React (Vite) single-page app for managing templates, labels, and print selections.
- **Containerization** – Docker images for both services orchestrated with Docker Compose.

## Quick start with Docker Compose

```bash
docker compose up --build
```

The command builds both containers, launches the Flask API on <http://localhost:5000>, and serves the React UI from <http://localhost:3000>. Application data is stored in a named Docker volume so template and label changes persist between restarts.

When you are done, shut everything down with:

```bash
docker compose down
```

## Local development without Docker

### Backend

1. Create a virtual environment and install dependencies:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   python -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
2. Run the API:
   ```bash
   flask --app labelgen:create_app --debug run
   ```
3. The API will be available at <http://127.0.0.1:5000>. The first request initializes `instance/labelgen.sqlite`.

Useful endpoints:

- `GET /api/templates` – list templates.
- `POST /api/templates` – create a template.
- `GET /api/labels` – list labels.
- `POST /api/labels/print` – download a PDF for selected labels.

### Frontend

1. Install dependencies and start the dev server:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm install
   npm run dev
   ```
2. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` to override the API base URL if necessary.
3. Open <http://127.0.0.1:3000> to use the interface. The app expects the backend to run on port 5000 by default.

### PDF generation

Select labels in the frontend and click **Download selected as PDF**. The browser downloads a multi-label PDF (10 labels per US letter page) generated by the backend.

## Testing

Currently there are no automated tests. Run the API and frontend locally to verify flows and the PDF output.
